Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join k8sapi.master.net:6443 --token y0gvh5.ep4vog9w9pqilyse \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:af06f585966685903a5de869c368c6aa33a3f6f16171a60765e5d29f0048560d \
        --control-plane --certificate-key 7c37d97f3a9867d77baa976e8345b47dce09c5303b7162ce0cb13ccb895bc37e

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join k8sapi.master.net:6443 --token y0gvh5.ep4vog9w9pqilyse \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:af06f585966685903a5de869c368c6aa33a3f6f16171a60765e5d29f0048560d
